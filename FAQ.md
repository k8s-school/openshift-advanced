# Authentication

## What is the lifetime of a token generated by the TokerRequest API?

Extract from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#bound-service-account-token-volume

A token served for a TokenRequest expires either when the pod is deleted or after a defined lifespan (by default, that is 1 hour). The kubelet also refreshes that token before the token expires. The token is bound to the specific Pod and has the kube-apiserver as its audience.

# Openshift management

## What does the installer 'openshift-install destroy' command?

Undocumented, and debug log are not useful
"openshift-install destroy -h" does not help

Having a look at the code it seems it stop and then remove the VMs.
See https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/cmd/openshift-install/destroy.go
and https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/dd15963db02cabddf2c26870d230bd1fbbaddb0c/pkg/destroy/ovirt/destroyer.go#L63C2-L63C24

## About Openshift and system updates

Extract from https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/updating/understanding_updates/intro-to-updates.html

The CVO monitors the state of each applied resource and the states reported by all cluster Operators. The CVO only proceeds with the update when all manifests and cluster Operators in the active Runlevel reach a stable condition. After the CVO updates the entire control plane through this process, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the operating system and configuration of every node in the cluster.

# Machine api

## How to troubleshoot machine-api?

Explanation for the "orphan machine" use case (creation of of machine using the export of an existing machine in a machineset) is available [here](./infra/az/machineset/failure-examples).

Controllers are in namespaces `openshift-machine-api` (machineset, machine) and `openshift-cloud-controller-manager` (cloud vm).

# RBAC

## How to list all verbs?

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661494/list-of-kubernetes-rbac-rule-verbs

```shell
kubectl proxy --port=8080

# Disaster recovery

# Key Recovery Objectives
Among the components of a DR plan are two key parameters that define how long your business can afford to be offline and how much data loss it can tolerate. These are the **Recovery Time Objective** (RTO) and **Recovery Point Objective** (RPO).

**RTO** is the goal your organization sets for the maximum length of time it should take to restore normal operations following an outage or data loss.

**RPO** is your goal for the maximum amount of data the organization can tolerate losing. This parameter is measured in time: from the moment a failure occurs to your last valid data backup. For example, if you experience a failure now and your last full data backup was 24 hours ago, the RPO is 24 hours.

# Network

## What happen if `pod.spec.containers.ports` is not specified in `pod.yaml`

With respect to the inline documentation:
```shell
kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.ports | head -n 10
KIND:       Pod
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: ports <[]ContainerPort>

DESCRIPTION:
    List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES
    NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
    default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the
    network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the
